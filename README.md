A simple program written in Python for monitoring the user's computer activity using keylogging and screen monitoring with OCR.(WIP) It's intended use is for monitoring students activities on school computers during lessons at educational institutes and for parental control. Upon detecting devious activity i.e visiting NSFW sites, the program will take certain actions ranging from merely warning the user to cease their devious acts to freezing(Randering it unuseable) the computer(WIP) until unfrozen by a teacher or instructor or a parent using a phone app or email or Facebook messenge. The program can also inform the instructor/parent about the activity through email, Facebook message, and the phone app . If told to inform the instructor/parent, the program will send the computer's name, words detected, a screenshot of the computer screen and even the photo of the user's using the web cam if available.(WIP)

WIP = Work in progress
